Before we start talking about code and all the awesome stuff you can build with it we should understand why we need it and where it came from.
Everyday we use all sorts of different computers that are running on thousands of lines of code, ATM machines, Cash registers, Cell phones, Laptops
even the cars we drive run on computers.

 A lot of the information we get is through the internet.. I think thats a good place to start. So where did the internet come from?
  - The internet began life in 1969, when scientists working for the US Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now known as DARPA) connected computer networks at the University of California and the Stanford Research Institute.
  - The internet was first created because we needed to be able to send information to people that might be located far away. Think "email"
  - "internet" inter means between and net means network "the between network"
